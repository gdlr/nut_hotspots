# Nutrient hotspot preliminary analysis


# Data are too big to upload to Git. Reach out if you want my layers!

Files:
## Hotspot Processing
This file takes raw data and converts them to a 2 degree grid, then masks the layers to the US EEZ.

## Hotspot 2dg
This file takes the layers that were made in the hotspot processing file and combines them to find pollution hotspots in the US.
